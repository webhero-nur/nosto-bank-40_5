JS Concepts:
1. null vs undefined
    null -> intentional absence of the value
    undefined -> value does not exists
2. == vs ===
    == -> compare values by converting to same format
    === -> compare values with type of the value
3. scope: block, function, global
    block scope -> initialized variable or assigned value only usable within the block
    function scope -> initialized variable or working mechanism only valid inside the function
    global scope -> variable is accessable and modifiedable from anywhere within the file
